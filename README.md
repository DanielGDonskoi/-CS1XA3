##CUSTOM IDEAS
#File Cleanup
##Iterates through the files in it's own directory except project_analyze.sh and README.md and assembles a list of them based on extensions.
##For each file, it creates a new directory for files of that extension type. If that directory already exists, add the file to that directory
##Continues until every file has been copied to it's directory and has been removed from the same directory as project_analyze.sh
##By the end, each file should be in it's appropriate extension directory and project_analyze.sh and README.md are the only files remaining
